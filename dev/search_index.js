For example, mathbfA could be an identity matrix if boldsymbolu_k is assumed to be independently and identically distributed. mathbfA can be  the numerator relationship matrix, when boldsymbolu is a vector of polygenic effects and mathbfG represents the additive-genetic variance not explained by molecular markers. Note that boldsymbolu can also be a concatenation of vectors of different types of random effects, such as litter, pen, polygenic and maternal effects. The vector boldsymbole_i of residuals are a priori assumed to be independently and identically following multivariate normal distributions with null mean and covariance matrix mathbfR, which in turn is a priori assumed to have an inverse Wishart prior distribution, W_t^-1left(mathbfS_enu_eright). Note that when number of traits t=1, the priors for mathbfG and mathbfR in single-trait analyses follow scaled inverted chi-square distributions.","category":"section"},{"location":"theory/theory/#Priors-for-marker-effects","page":"Some Theory","title":"Priors for marker effects","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"theory/theory/#single-trait-BayesA","page":"Some Theory","title":"single-trait BayesA","text":"The prior assumption is that marker effects have identical and independent univariate-t distributions each with a null mean, scale parameter S^2_alpha and nu degrees of freedom.

The covariance matrix boldsymbolG is a priori assumed to follow an inverse Wishart distribution, W_t^-1left(mathbfS_betanu_betaright).\n\nIn the most general case, any marker effect might be zero for any possible combination of t traits resulting in 2^t possible combinations of boldsymboldelta_l. For example, in a t=2 trait model, there are 2^t=4 combinations for  boldsymboldelta_l: (00), (01), (10), (11). Suppose in general we use numerical labels \"1\", \"2\",ldots, \"l\" for the 2^t possible outcomes for  boldsymboldelta_l, then the prior for  boldsymboldelta_l is a categorical distribution\n\npleft(boldsymboldelta_l=iright)= Pi_1Ileft(boldsymboldelta_l=1right)+Pi_2Ileft(boldsymboldelta_l=2right)++Pi_lIleft(boldsymboldelta_l=lright)\n\nwhere sum_i=1^lPi_i=1 with Pi_i being the prior probability that the vector boldsymboldelta_l corresponds to the vector labelled i. A Dirichlet distribution with all parameters equal to one, i.e., a uniform distribution, can be used for the prior for boldsymbolPi=left(Pi_1Pi_2Pi_lright).   \n\nThe differences in multi-trait BayesB method is that the prior for boldsymbolbeta_l is a multivariate t distribution, rather than a multivariate normal distribution. This is equivalent to assuming boldsymbolbeta_l has a multivariate normal distribution with null mean and locus-specific covariance matrix boldsymbolG_l, which is assigned an inverse Wishart prior, W_t^-1left(mathbfS_betanu_betaright). Multi-trait BayesA method is a special case of multi-trait BayesB method where boldsymboldelta_l is always a vector of ones.\n\nreferencesMeuwissen T, Hayes B, Goddard M.

These models are especially useful for, but not limited to, routine single-trait and multi-trait genomic prediction and genome-wide association studies using either complete or incomplete genomic data (\"single-step\" methods). Currently, JWAS provides broad scope of analyses, e.g., a wide collection of Bayesian methods for whole-genome analyses, including shrinkage estimation and variable selection methods. The features of JWAS include:\n\nUnivariate (single-trait) analysis\nMultivariate (multi-trait) analysis  \nNo limitations on fixed effects (e.g., herd, year, age, sex)\nRandom effects other than markers (e.g., litter, pen)                                  \nRandom effects using pedigree information\nAdditive genetic effects\nMaternal effects\nRandom permanent environmental effects  \nCorrelated residuals\t\t\nCorrelated random effects\nUnknown (or known) variance components\nUse of genomic information\nComplete genomic data                                      \t\t\nIncomplete genomic data (singe-step)","category":"section"},{"location":"#Supporting-and-Citing","page":"Home","title":"Supporting and Citing","text":"We hope the friendly user interface and fast computing speed of JWAS will provide power and convenience for users in both industry and academia to analyze large datasets.

Junior scientists can understand and learn the methodologies for whole-genome analyses by using JWAS and reading the tutorials and source code.\n\nIf you would like to help support JWAS, please star the repository on the upper right corner here as such statistic will help to demonstrate the active involvement of the community.
