# Mixed effect neural network: Genotypes -> (complete/incomplete) Intemediate omics features -> Phenotyes

Tips:
* Put the names of omics features in the `build_model()` function through the `latent_traits` argument.
* If there are many omics features (e.g., 1000), it is recommanded to set `printout_model_info=false` in the `runMCMC()` function.
* Missing omics data for individuals in the training dataset (i.e., individuals with phenotypes) is allowed. When you read a file with missing values via the `CSV.read()` function, the `missingstrings` argument should be used to set sentinel values that will be parsed as `missing`.
* For individuals in the testing dataset (i.e., individuals without phenotypes), if the testing individuals have complete omics data, then incorporating the omics data of those individuals may improve the relationship between input layer (genotype) and middle layer (omics).


## example(o1): fully-connected neural networks with observed intemediate omics features
* nonlinear function (to define relationship between omics and phenotye): sigmoid (other supported activation functions: "tanh", "relu", "leakyrelu", "linear")
* number of omics features in the middle layer: 10
* Bayesian model: multiple independent single-trait BayesC (to sample marker effects on intemediate omics)
* sample the missing omics in the middle layer: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

## Includes a residual that is not mediated by other omics features
To include residuals polygenic component (i.e. directly from genotypes to phenotypes, not mediated by omics features), you can additional hidden nodes in the middle layer (see example (o2)). This can also be achieved in a partial-connected neural network in a same manner.

![](https://github.com/zhaotianjing/figures/blob/main/wiki_omics_residual.png?raw=true)

### example(o2): fully-connected neural network with residuals

For all individuals, this extra hidden node will be treated as unknown to be sampled.

```julia
# Step 1: Load packages
using JWAS,DataFrames,CSV,Statistics,JWAS.Datasets, Random, HTTP 
Random.seed!(123)

# Step 2: Read data (from github)
phenofile  = HTTP.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhaotianjing/nnmm_doc/main/data_simulation/y.csv").body
omicsfile  = HTTP.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhaotianjing/nnmm_doc/main/data_simulation/omics.csv").body
genofile   = HTTP.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhaotianjing/nnmm_doc/main/data_simulation/geno_n100_p200.csv").body
phenotypes = CSV.read(phenofile,DataFrame)
omics      = CSV.read(omicsfile,DataFrame)
geno_df    = CSV.read(genofile,DataFrame)

insertcols!(omics, :residual => missing)  #create a hidden node to account for residuals
omics[!,:residual] = convert(Vector{Union{Missing,Float64}}, omics[!,:residual]) #transform the datatype is required for Julia
omics_names = names(omics)[2:end]  #get names of 10 omics and 1 hidden node
insertcols!(omics,2,:y => phenotypes[:,:y], :bv => phenotypes[:,:bv]) #phenotype and omics should be in the same dataframe

genotypes = get_genotypes(geno_df,separator=',',method="BayesC")

# Step 3: Build Model Equations
model_equation  ="y = intercept + genotypes" 
model = build_model(model_equation,
		    num_hidden_nodes=11,   #10 omcis and 1 hidden node
                    latent_traits=omics_names,
		    nonlinear_function="sigmoid")

# Step 4: Run Analysis
out = runMCMC(model,omics,chain_length=5000,printout_model_info=false)

# Step 5: Check Accuruacy
results    = innerjoin(out["EBV_NonLinear"], omics, on = :ID)
accuruacy  = cor(results[!,:EBV],results[!,:bv])
```

Users can also add extra hidden nodes in the partial-connected neural network. Please check next documentation for building a partial-connected neural network.

## Output files
Same as those described in Part2.

### Julia Tips:
* You may want to set missing values manually, for example, setting the phenotypes for individuals in testing dataset as `missing`. Firstly, the type of  columns should be changed to allow `missing`, e.g., `phenotypes[!,:y] =  convert(Vector{Union{Missing,Float64}}, phenotypes[!,:y])`. Then, `missing` can be set manually, e.g., `phenotypes[10:11,:y1] .= missing` forces the 10th and 11th elements to be `missing`.
